# Feeridium

## IMPORTANT UPDATE:
As of 26th of November 2024, this repository will not be updated for the time being. 

Thomas Iridium (from the original Iridium Overview) came back, updated the overview and made it open source [here](https://github.com/iridiumops/overview). I'm going to join forces with him there as a contributor. Thank you for your trust and fly safe!

## ---------------

## About
This EVE Online Overview Pack is a tribute to the original Iridium Overview and uses it as a basis for further developments.

## Install
- Download the latest [release](https://github.com/feertruelight/feeridium/releases), unzip it and put the .yaml-File in the C:\Users\<user>\Documents\EVE\Overview folder.
- In the EVE client, reset the overview settings (see [Uniwiki Overview](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Overview) for further information if you have never used a 3rd party overview before) and import the .yaml-File (check all checkboxes).

## Structure
The filenames are structured as follows:
feeridium_&lt;EVE Patch Version&gt;_&lt;Feeridium Version&gt;.yaml

This way you should find the latest files and be able to compare the changes between releases.

### EVE Patch Versions
| Version | Expansion |
|---------|-----------|
| 22.02   | Revenant  |
| 22.01   | Equinox   |
| 21.06   | Havoc     |
| 21.05   | Viridian  |

### Feeridium Versions
This will reset to 1 with the release of a new EVE patch version and gets incremented by 1 for each release I publish on Github.

## Optional Settings
Optionally you can add fleet broadcast settings. Just copy the following text in an in-game notepad and click the link:
