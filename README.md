## About
This EVE Online Overview Pack is a tribute to the original Iridium Overview and uses it as a basis for further developments.

## Structure
The filenames are structured as follows:
feeridium_&lt;eve patch version&gt;_&lt;feeridium version&gt;.yaml

This way you should find the latest files and be able to compare the changes.

## Optional Settings
Optionally you can add fleet broadcast settings. Just copy the following text in an in-game notepad and click the link:

&lt;url=sharedSetting:f89279b7ddd197896b2ad61ee6a51e9a85d3997d//1//3&gt;Feeridium Fleet - Patch 22.01&lt;/url&gt;
